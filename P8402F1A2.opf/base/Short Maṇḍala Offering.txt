The ground is purified with scented water and strewn with flowers.

It is adorned with Sumeru, the king of mountains, the four quarters of the universe, and the
sun and the moon;

Thinking of it as the blessed buddha-fields, I offer it.

By virtue of this offering, may all beings here and now attain the happiness of that pure land!

↑ The authorship of this famous offering prayer is unclear, and it is likely that it predates
Drakpa Gyalsen (1147–1216). Still, the earliest available version, which differs slightly
from the one presented here, is to be found in his consecration manual, Arga'i cho ga dang
rab tu gnas pa don gsal. See Sa skya bka' 'bum (Dehra Dun: Sakya Center), 15 volumes, vol.
9, 22a.3: sa gzhi spos kyis byugs shing me tog gtor/ ri rab gling bzhis legs par brgyan
pa 'di/ sangs rgyas zhing du dmigs shing phul ba yis/ 'gro rnams rnam dag zhing la spyod
par shog/ Others have claimed that these four lines were composed by King Trisong Detsen,
Pakpa Lodrö Gyaltsen, the author of the 37 Point Maṇḍala Offering, or spoken by the legendary
Dharmodgata (chos 'phags) in response to requests made by the bodhisattva Sadāprarudita
(rtag tu ngu), whose story of extraordinary self-sacrifice is told in the Prajñāpāramitā
sūtras.
